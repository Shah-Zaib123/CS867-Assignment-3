# Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network

* The goal is to classify around 25k images of size **150x150** distributed under 6 categories.  
* **Class Categories:**  Buildings(Label 0), Forest(Label 1), Glacier(Label 2), Mountain(Label 3), Sea(Label 4), Street(Label 5).
* **CNN Architecture Used:** VGG16
* **Techniques Used:** Transfer learning And Data Augmentation. 
* **DataSource:** [Intel Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification)
* Dataset is in following manner:\
         • **Training set** = 14k+ 150x150 Images in **seg_train** folder for training spread.\
         • **Validation set** = 3k+ 150x150 Images in **seg_test** folder for cross-validation spread.\
         • **Test set** = 7k+ 150x150 Images in **seg_pred** folder as test spread.\
